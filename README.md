 Python Basics

 Syntax and Variables
- Introduction to Python syntax and conventions.
- How to declare and use variables.

 Data Types
- **Primitive Data Types**: Strings, Numbers (integers and floats), Booleans.
- **Type Conversion**: Converting between different data types.
- **Constants**: Understanding constants in Python.

 Operators
- Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

Control Flow
- Using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements for decision making.
- Nested `if-else` structures.

 Loops
- `for` loop, `while` loop, and loop control (break, continue, pass).
- **Note**: Although loops in Python are discussed here, comparisons with C loops are also mentioned.

Data Structures

 Arrays
- Basic array usage and methods.

 Strings and String Methods
- Common string operations and built-in methods.

 Lists, Dictionaries, and Sets
- Working with lists, dictionaries, and sets.

 Modules and File Handling
- Creating and importing modules.
- Working with Python packages.
- File reading and writing operations.

 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

 Core OOP Concepts
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details.
- **Encapsulation**: Binding data and functions together.
- **Inheritance**: Extending classes to share functionality.
- **Polymorphism**: Using a unified interface for different data types.

 Classes and Objects
- Defining classes and creating objects.
- Understanding class variables, instance methods, and `__init__()`.
- Usage of private variables for encapsulation.

 Special Methods
- `__str__()` and `__repr__()` for object representation.
- `__eq__()` and `__hash__()` for comparison and hashing.

 Properties and Inheritance
- Using the `@property` decorator to create read-only properties.
- Deleting properties.
- Understanding single and multiple inheritance, overriding methods, and `super()`.
- Working with abstract classes.

 Abstraction and Polymorphism
- Implementing abstract methods and classes.
- **Meta Classes**: An advanced topic on how Python uses meta classes.
- **Operator Overloading**: Customizing operator behavior.
- **Method Overloading**: Implementing functions that handle different arguments.
